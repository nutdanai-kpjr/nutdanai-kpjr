### **All-in-One Mobile Dev At Your Service**  

Iâ€™m an all-in-one mobile devâ€”React Native is my main stack, but I donâ€™t stop there. I dive deep into SwiftUI, Kotlin, Jetpack Compose, and whatever else it takes to get things running natively. Need a custom native module? Done. Watch app? Absolutely. Widgets, share extensions? No problem. If it runs on a phone, watch, tablet, or something experimental, Iâ€™ll figure it out.  

Not a fan of React Native? No problemâ€”I do Flutter too.  
Think mobile is dead? Iâ€™d argue otherwiseâ€”but either way, Iâ€™m not just stuck there.  

### **I Build Across Platforms:**  
âœ… **Mobile apps** (iOS, Android, React Native, Flutter)  
âœ… **Web apps** (React, Next.js, Svelte)  
âœ… **Desktop apps** (Electronâ€”not native, but it gets the job done)  
âœ… **Chrome extensions** (Manifest V3 chaos included)  
âœ… **Watch apps** (watchOS? Ready. Wear OS? Not yet, but I pick things up fast.)  
âž– **VisionOS?** Not yetâ€”but if demand picks up, Iâ€™ll jump in.  

### **Beyond Just Code**  
Iâ€™m not just here to write codeâ€”Iâ€™m here to solve problems. I take a **product-first approach**, always looking at how people actually use apps, where they struggle, and how to make their experience smoother. Whether itâ€™s rethinking a feature, streamlining a UI, or tackling customer pain points, I focus on building things that donâ€™t just work but feel **intuitive, seamless, and valuable**.  

### **Navigating the Madness**  
Every platform has its quirks.  

**Android?** A constant battle with breaking changesâ€”notifications, background tasks, and an ever-growing list of versions to support (8 through 15 and counting). Respect to Android devs for surviving this madness.  

**iOS?** Always chasing Appleâ€™s latest toysâ€”widgets, Live Activities, Control Center tweaks, Lock Screen widgets, custom filters. Every year, something new to build.  

**Chrome extensions?** A paranoia-fueled rollercoaster of security policies (thanks, ad blockers, for making Google nervous).  

But hey, I thrive on this. Someoneâ€™s gotta keep things from falling apart with every updateâ€”and stay ahead of the curve while doing it.  

So, if youâ€™re building something ambitious, need a helping hand with an extension, integration, or just making things actually work, Iâ€™m ready. ðŸš€
