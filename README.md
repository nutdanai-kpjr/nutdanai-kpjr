### 💻 Frontend & Mobile Developer – React, React Native, Native Integrations

I'm a frontend developer focused on **mobile and web**. My core stack includes **React**, **React Native**, and **TypeScript**, with deep native integration using **SwiftUI** and **Jetpack Compose**.
Need a custom module, widget, or Apple Watch app? I've shipped it.

I also work with **Flutter**, and cover multiple platforms—web, desktop, and extensions.

### 🛠️ What I Build

* 📱 **Mobile Apps** – iOS, Android (React Native, Flutter, SwiftUI, Jetpack Compose)
* 🌐 **Web Apps** – React, Next.js, Svelte
* 🖥️ **Desktop Apps** – Electron
* 🧩 **Browser Extensions** – Chrome (Manifest V3)
* ⌚ **Watch Apps** – Apple Watch (watchOS)

### 🚀 How I Work

I take a **product-first** approach—focused on performance, clean UI, and solving real user problems.
I stay ahead of platform changes and API shifts to keep experiences smooth and stable.
